I learned about how to create a variable and assign it a colour and use that variable in the whole css.

    :root{
        --border-color: #144fc6;
        --fill-color: #6ab3f8;
    }


We used the root tag to declare and initialize the variable with the colour.

    background-color: var(--fill-color);


We used the var function to use the fill color variable for the background color in the previous line of code
